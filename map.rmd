## Interactive Map Assignment: Developing Data Products

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

## Code
```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,message=FALSE}
library(leaflet)

my_home <- leaflet()%>%
    addTiles()%>%
    addMarkers(lat = 38.31667,lng=109.7389,
               popup = "Home")

```

## Map
```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
my_home
```
